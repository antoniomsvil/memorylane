Passionate nights and long talks is what really got to know each other, and the more I knew about you, the more I wanted to still find out. It was very sad when our time in Thailand came to an end, we knew somehow it was going to finish but we were trying to avoid it in our head..

It was like we never stopped talking, remembering our days but also talking about the days apart and how we do not want to be apart for our future. I asked myself and us, are we willing to do this? And saying yes was the best decision, having you in my life again since that day has been a dream come true.

It was supposed to be 6 days if you remember but nooope.. month and a half. But what a month and a half. Met your friends and saw how surrounded of love you are, but most importantly I connected with you in a real way. We had real and hearted conversations and we realized that this was the right decision.. also met Argon boi.. Making you coffee every morning is one of my favorite things to do, not because it gives you that energy you need to kick the morning, but its because is a moment we wake up together and I get to see your beautiful face in the morning, and where we connect as a couple to begin our respective day without any load.", emoji: "🌷" },

The second trip to California started beautifully, it was nice to see each other again, we got to do things and explore, glamping in the raven and having amazing mornings in the nature together.. but something was missing. Not the most traditional way, but it was time to propose… I was NERVOUS, even if we literally talked about it, but I choose you, and I will choose you every single time and day of my life.", emoji: "🌺" },

The fact that you wake up every day and have to work with kids that need extra attention is one of the many pieces of evidence of the huge heart you have.", emoji: "🌹" },
